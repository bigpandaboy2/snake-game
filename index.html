    <p id="intro">Well, this is very raw game of online snake with 
                   some basic movements and function. It record the 
                   score on the left corner and your highest score on 
                   the right. The food appears on random positions 
                   and even spawns inside the snake! Since the game 
                   is raw, it will be updated, and feel free to add
                   some comments about the future alterations!

    <!-- 1. Reverse snake movement should be blocked. Now if snake length is 1 and you press arrow key opposite to the current movement direction  
    the snake would go in that opposite direction and the snake is > 1 - it would reset the game which is obvious but would make players mad :)
    2. Food generation should be adjusted so food would not generates inside the snake, 
    for now it happens  sometime. Probably would use the same logic as in the collision detection function. -->
